		    	<br>

          		 
          		 <p>I love to work on mobile and web ideas in my free time. It's exciting to work on something from scratch and eventually evolve to a product that my friends and family can use. That is why I want to creatively solve the world's simplest problems through innovation. Currently I enjoy using Android and Django to build out my ideas.</p>

          		 <br>

          		 <p>If I'm not hacking, I'm probably working out, playing tennis, or jamming on my guitar. I picked up guitar and tennis in high school and haven't looked back since. My guitar of choice is a Schecter Hellraiser, which is as scary as it sounds! Just kidding, it actually looks beautiful and plays even better. I enjoy jamming to neoclassical and alternative rock. Currently I'm learning to play Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p>

          		 <p>Hopefully this gave you a good sense of who I am. For more information about my projects check out some of my work below!</p>
